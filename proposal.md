# Proposal for keyextract


Keyextract is a CLI application that allows user to type in a url and get meta data about the website and it's contents. 

I thought of this idea when I was working on my slack bot project  and came across the problem of scraping data on anime quotes and thought how nice would it be if i could just type in a command and get all the data i need.

version 1/mvp of this project or mvp just get's the data and displays it to the termianl.

version 2 will be able to persit the data it collects into  postgress db or mongodb.
